Mercury Converter is a powerful, native Android application designed to download and convert YouTube videos to MP3 format directly on your device.

It uses **yt-dlp** (Nightly builds) and **FFmpeg** to bypass modern YouTube restrictions (HTTP 403 / PO Token errors) and ensure high-quality audio extraction.

##  Features:

* ** MP3 Conversion:** Automatically extracts audio and converts it to high-quality MP3 using a native FFmpeg binary.
* ** Anti-Bot Bypass:** Uses the `_NIGHTLY` update channel and client emulation (`android_testsuite`) to bypass YouTube's latest "PO Token" and bot protections.
* ** Multi-Language:** Full support for **English** 🇺🇸 and **Turkish** 🇹🇷 (Auto-detects system language).
* ** Easy Access:** Saves files directly to the public `Downloads/MercuryFile` directory.
* ** Auto-Update:** Checks and updates the internal yt-dlp engine on launch to keep up with YouTube changes.

##  Technical Details:

This project solves several complex challenges in Android development:

* **Manual FFmpeg Detection:** Implements a custom detective logic to find the `libffmpeg.so` binary across `nativeLibraryDir`, `filesDir`, and `dataDir` to prevent "FFmpeg not found" errors on different Android versions.
* **Engine Management:** Updates `yt-dlp` to the latest nightly build dynamically.
* **Scoped Storage:** Compliant with Android 11+ storage policies, writing to the public Downloads collection.
